This repo contains the code to generate tables and plots of [SFARI Phenotypic Data â€“ Researcher Feedback Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1W0RI6o4_44GvYoOeFR_uQNEljX4UmxWxj20D7G-Nwr0/edit)

Tables and charts presented during the Science Meeting (7.2.2025) were generated by [science_meeting.Rmd](science_meeting.Rmd)
Tables and charts presented during the CDWG (5.12.25) were generated by [cdwg_survey_results.Rmd](cdwg_survey_results.Rmd).

To execute either .Rmd:

- Individuals within the Simons Foundation can download data as a CSV from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yJm2FvUAkoavEbzQdsrmexj1e6ahE69EeNbId2yGeI/edit?resourcekey=&gid=2039702603#gid=2039702603)
- Place the CSV into [/data](data)
- In the "setup" Rmd chunk, set the name of responses_file in setup() -- e.g., setup(responses_file = "data/responses_2025-05-11.csv")
- Execute the .Rmd
